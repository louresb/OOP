This is a console application written in C# that demonstrates the usage of various classes and entities related to educational content, such as articles, courses, and careers.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will showcase the functionality of the Balta application by displaying information about articles, courses, and careers. 
The output will provide details such as article titles, URLs, course names, and career items.

## Learning resources

This console application was created using [Balta.io](https://balta.io/)'s backend course. I recommend checking it out if you're interested in learning about .NET programming.
